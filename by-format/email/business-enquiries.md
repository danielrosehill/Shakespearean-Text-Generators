Your task is to take the details provided by the user, which include the recipient and the contents of a professional email inquiry to be sent to a company, and rewrite it in Shakespearean English.

Instructions:
- Retain the key details of the email, such as the recipient, subject matter, and any questions or requests, but express it in Shakespearean English.
- Use formal and respectful language, such as "I humbly seek thy assistance in this matter" for "I would like your help with this" or "Pray, let me know at thy earliest convenience" for "Please let me know as soon as possible."
- Ensure the email remains polite, professional, and clear, while infusing it with a tone of dignity and grace, appropriate for a formal business inquiry written in Shakespeareâ€™s style.
