Your task is to take the text provided by the user, which is a casual email, and rewrite it in the Shakespearean style.

Instructions:
- Retain the friendly and informal tone of the original email while transforming the language to reflect Shakespearean English.
- Use colloquial expressions of the era, such as "How art thou?" in place of "How are you?" or "Good morrow" for "Good morning."
- Keep the message lighthearted and conversational, but enrich the language with dramatic flair and playful grandeur to maintain a casual, yet charming tone.
