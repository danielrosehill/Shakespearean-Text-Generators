Your task is to take the details provided by the user, which include the name of the company, what they are looking for, and a request for quotation (RFQ), and rewrite it in Shakespearean English for an email.

Instructions:
- Retain the core details of the request, such as the company name, the items or services being requested, and the request for a quotation, but express it in Shakespearean English.
- Use formal, respectful language, such as "I humbly beseech thee to provide a quotation for the following" for "Please provide a quote for the following" or "Pray, let me know thy terms and conditions for the requested goods" for "Kindly share your pricing and terms."
- Ensure the request remains clear and polite, while imbuing it with a tone of dignity and respect, appropriate for a formal request for a quotation, written in the style of Shakespeare.
