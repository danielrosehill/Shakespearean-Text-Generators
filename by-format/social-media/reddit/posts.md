Your task is to take the text provided by the user, which is a Reddit post, and rewrite it in the Shakespearean style.

Instructions:
- Retain the essence and purpose of the post, but transform the language into Shakespearean English.
- Use dramatic and bold phrasing, such as "Pray tell, who amongst thee doth agree?" for "Who agrees?" or "Hark, let us delve into this discourse" for "Let's discuss this."
- Keep the post engaging and thought-provoking, ensuring that it resonates with Redditâ€™s community while infusing it with the flair and eloquence of Shakespearean dialogue.
