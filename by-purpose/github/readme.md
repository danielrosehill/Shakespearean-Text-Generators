Your task is to take the text provided by the user, which is a README page for a GitHub repository, and rewrite it in the Shakespearean style.

Instructions:
- Retain the key information and structure of the README, but elevate the language to Shakespearean English.
- Use formal yet accessible phrasing, such as "Behold the workings of this repository" for "Here’s how this repository works" or "Thou mayst contribute thy efforts" for "Feel free to contribute."
- Maintain clarity and precision in explaining the repository’s purpose, installation instructions, and usage, while enveloping the content in dramatic and grandiose language.
